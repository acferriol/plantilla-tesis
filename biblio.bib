  abstract = {In the presence of the Y-chromosomal gene Sry, the bipotential mouse
	gonads develop as testes rather than as ovaries. The autosomal gene
	Sox9, a likely and possibly direct Sry target, can induce testis
	development in the absence of Sry. Sox9 is thus sufficient but not
	necessarily essential for testis induction. Mutational inactivation
	of one allele of SOX9/Sox9 causes sex reversal in humans but not
	in mice. Because Sox9(-/-) embryos die around Embryonic Day 11.5
	(E11.5) at the onset of testicular morphogenesis, differentiation
	of the mutant XY gonad can be analyzed only ex vivo in organ culture.
	We have therefore conditionally inactivated both Sox9 alleles in
	the gonadal anlagen using the CRE/loxP recombination system, whereby
	CRE recombinase is under control of the cytokeratin 19 promoter.
	Analysis of resulting Sox9(-/-) XY gonads up to E15.5 reveals immediate,
	complete sex reversal, as shown by expression of the early ovary-specific
	markers Wnt4 and Foxl2 and by lack of testis cord and Leydig cell
	formation. Sry expression in mutant XY gonads indicates that downregulation
	of Wnt4 and Foxl2 is dependent on Sox9 rather than on Sry. Our results
	provide in vivo proof that, in contrast to the situation in humans,
	complete XY sex reversal in mice requires inactivation of both Sox9
	alleles and that Sox9 is essential for testogenesis in mice.},

  abstract = {Sox9 and Sox8 are transcription factors expressed in embryonic and
	postnatal Sertoli cells of the mouse testis. Sox9 inactivation prior
	to the sex determination stage leads to complete XY sex reversal.
	In contrast, there is normal embryonic testis development in Sox8
	mutants which are initially fertile, but later develop progressive
	seminiferous tubule failure and infertility. To determine whether
	Sox9 is required for testis development after the initial steps of
	sex determination, we crossed Sox9(flox) mice with an AMH-Cre transgenic
	line thereby completely deleting Sox9 in Sertoli cells by E14.0.
	Conditional Sox9 null mutants show normal embryonic testis development
	and are initially fertile, but, like Sox8(-/-) mutants, become sterile
	from dysfunctional spermatogenesis at about 5 months. To see whether
	Sox8 may compensate for the absence of Sox9 during embryonic testis
	differentiation, we generated a Sox9 conditional knockout on a Sox8
	mutant background. In the double mutants, differentiation of testis
	cords into seminiferous testis tubules ceases after P6 in the absence
	of one Sox8 allele, and after P0 in the absence of both Sox8 alleles,
	leading to complete primary infertility. Sox9,Sox8 double nullizygous
	testes show upregulation of early ovary-specific markers and downregulation
	of Sertoli intercellular junctions at E15.5. Their very low Amh levels
	still cause complete regression of the Müllerian duct but with reduced
	penetrance. This study shows that testis cord differentiation is
	independent of Sox9, and that concerted Sox9 and Sox8 function in
	post E14.0 Sertoli cells is essential for the maintenance of testicular
	function.},

	the information thus generated to suggest how seasonal reproduction
	might be influenced by global climate change. Food availability and
	ambient temperature determine energy balance, and variation in energy
	balance is the ultimate cause of seasonal breeding in all mammals

	long-lived mammals from the highest latitudes down to the mid-tropics.
	It is much less common in shorter lived mammals at all latitudes.
	An unknown predictive cue triggers reproduction in some desert and
	dry grassland species when it rains. The available information suggests
	that as our climate changes the small rodents of the world may adapt
	rather easily but the longer lived mammals whose reproduction is

  abstract = {The objectives of this paper are to organize our concepts about the
	environmental regulation of reproduction in mammals and to delineate
	important gaps in our knowledge of this subject. The environmental
	factors of major importance for mammalian reproduction are food availability,
	ambient temperature, rainfall, the day/night cycle and a variety
	of social cues. The synthesis offered here uses as its core the bioenergetic
	control of reproduction. Thus, for example, annual patterns of breeding
	are viewed as reflecting primarily the caloric costs of the female's
	reproductive effort as they relate to the energetic costs and gains
	associated with her foraging effort. Body size of the female is an
	important consideration since it is correlated with both potential
	fat reserves and life span. Variation in nutrient availability may
	or may not be an important consideration. The evolutionary forces
	that have shaped the breeding success of males usually are fundamentally
	different from those acting on females and, by implication, the environmental
	controls governing reproduction probably also often differ either
	qualitatively or quantitatively in the two sexes. Mammals often live
	in habitats where energetic and nutrient challenges vary seasonally,
	even in the tropics. When seasonal breeding is required, a mammal
	may use a predictor such as photoperiod or a secondary plant compound
	to prepare metabolically for reproduction. A reasonable argument
	can be made, however, that opportunistic breeding, unenforced by
	a predictor, may be the most prevalent strategy extant among today's
	mammals. Social cues can have potent modulating actions. They can
	act either via discrete neural and endocrine pathways to alter specific
	processes such as ovulation, or they can induce nonspecific emotional
	states that secondarily affect reproduction. Many major gaps remain
	in our knowledge about the environmental regulation of mammalian
	reproduction. For one, we have a paucity of information about the
	annual patterns of breeding and about the mechanisms controlling
	these patterns in the most common mammals on the planet-the small
	to average-sized mammals living in the tropics. We probably have
	only a shallow conceptualization of the way available energy and
	nutrients control reproduction and, likewise, we may have only a
	narrow view of the potential kinds and uses of seasonal predictors.
	Finally, we have little appreciation of the way environmental cues
	interact with each other to control reproduction.},

	to differentiate into either a testis or an ovary. This decision
	is triggered by the expression of the sex-determining gene Sry, which

	that Sox9 is sufficient to induce testis formation. However, there

	determination. The studies presented here are the first experimental
	proof for an essential role for Sox9 in mediating a switch from the

	targeting, we show that homozygous deletion of Sox9 in XY gonads
	interferes with sex cord development and the activation of the male-specific
	markers Mis and P450scc, and leads to the expression of the female-specific
	markers Bmp2 and follistatin. Moreover, using a tissue specific knock-out
	approach, we show that Sox9 is involved in Sertoli cell differentiation,
	the activation of Mis and Sox8, and the inactivation of Sry. Finally,
	double knock-out analyses suggest that Sox8 reinforces Sox9 function

  abstract = {Most testicular features undergo major circannual variation in seasonal
	breeding species. Although the ultimate cause of these variations
	is known to be the photoperiod in most cases, very little is known
	about the genetic mechanisms by which these changes are modulated
	in the testis. Many genes involved in testis development are known
	to be expressed in the adult testis as well. Since these genes encode
	genetic regulatory factors, it is reasonable to suspect that they
	could play some role in the control of the adult testis function.
	Using immunological detection techniques and RT-Q-PCR, we have studied
	the spatio-temporal expression pattern of WT1, SF1, SOX9, AMH, and
	DMRT1 in 4 representative stages of the circannual cycle of the testes
	of Talpa occidentalis, a mole species with strict seasonal reproduction.
	AMH is not expressed at any stage of the cycle, showing that inactive
	adult testes are functionally different from pre-pubertal, juvenile
	ones. The continuous presence of primary spermatocytes may explain
	the permanent repression of AMH in the mole testis. WT1 and SF1 are
	down-regulated and SOX9 is up-regulated in regressed mole testes,
	suggesting that the modulation of the expression of these genes may
	be involved in the control of circannual gonad variation. Furthermore,
	SOX9 and DMRT1 show clear spermatogenic stage-dependent expression
	patterns. Both genes are expressed more intensely during the proliferative
	stages of spermatogonia, although SOX9 expression is limited to Sertoli
	cells, whereas DMRT1 is expressed in both Sertoli and spermatogonial
	cells. Available data suggest that intratesticular levels of testosterone
	could regulate circannual spermatogenic variations of seasonal breeders

	affected messenger and protein levels of claudin-11, a key Sertoli
	cell factor in the establishment of the hemotesticular barrier, at
	the time of two key events of postnatal testis development: 1) before
	puberty (postnatal d 14) during the establishment of the hemotesticular
	barrier, and 2) at the adult age (postnatal d 90) at the time of
	full spermatogenesis. The data obtained show that claudin-11 expression
	was inhibited in prepubertal rat testes exposed in utero to 2 and
	10 mg/kg x d flutamide. However, in adult testes, the inhibition
	was observed only with 2, and not with 10, mg/kg x d of the antiandrogen.
	It is shown here that these differences between prepubertal and adult
	testes could be related to dual and opposed regulation of claudin-11
	expression resulting from positive control by androgens and an inhibitory
	effect of postmeiotic germ cells. Indeed, testosterone is shown to
	stimulate claudin-11 expression in cultured Sertoli cells in a dose-
	and time-dependent manner (maximum effect with 0.06 microm after
	72 h of treatment). In contrast, postmeiotic germ cells potentially
	exert a negative effect on claudin-11 expression, because adult rat
	testes depleted in spermatids (after local irradiation) displayed
	increased claudin-11 expression, whereas in a model of cocultured
	Sertoli and germ cells, spermatids, but not spermatocytes, inhibited
	claudin-11 expression. The apparent absence of claudin-11 expression
	changes in adult rat testes exposed to 10 mg/kg x d flutamide therefore
	could result from the antagonistic effects of 1) the inhibitory action
	of the antiandrogen and 2) the stimulatory effect of the apoptotic
	germ cells on claudin-11 expression. Together, due to the key role
	of claudin-11 in the hemotesticular barrier, the present findings
	suggest that such regulatory mechanisms may potentially affect this
	barrier (re)modeling during spermatogenesis.},

  abstract = {We studied the location of Sox9 protein in the embryonic, juvenile,
	and adult rat testis by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.
	Sox9 belongs to a family of Sox proteins that are transcription factors
	and important in several developmental processes. In the incipient
	embryonic testis, Sox9 was prominently present in the gonadal blastema.
	With further embryonic differentiation, Sox9-positive cells arranged
	in the periphery of the testicular cords, showing the location of
	the Sertoli cells. Thereafter the immunoreaction for Sox9 gradually
	declined and was only weakly detectable in the 2-day-old postnatal
	rat testis. This situation remained for some period of time. In the
	15-day-old rat testis, Sox9 protein strongly reappeared in the testicular
	cords. In the adult, the Sertoli cells of most regions of the seminiferous
	tubules were positive for Sox9. The strongest reaction for Sox9 was
	found in the dark zone. However, clearly negative or only weakly
	positive spermatogenic stages for the protein were also found, as
	seen for example in the pale zone. In fertile 1-year-old rats this
	basic situation was still detectable. Analyzed rat ovaries were all
	negative for Sox9, showing the sex-specific nature of Sox9. The results
	showed that Sox9 protein is distinctly present in the developing
	and mature Sertoli cells, but that its presence and amount is dependent
	on the age and the spermatogenetic stage within the seminiferous
	tubuli. The prominent presence of Sox9 in the incipient testis and
	at puberty suggests that this protein is needed at important phases
	of aggregation and reorganization of the Sertoli cells. The age and
	stage-specific presence of Sox9 in the testicular cords and in the
	seminiferous tubules of the adult suggests that Sox9 also may have
	a pivotal role in germ cell differentiation.},

	Proportions of haploid, diploid and tetraploid cells were estimated

	cells into highly specialized germ cells (spermatozoa) are largely
	controlled by the hormonally (FSH and testosterone) regulated adjacent
	supporting Sertoli cells. However, the factors involved in this control
	remain largely unknown. In the present study, the technique of differential
	display PCR was used to identify target transcripts to FSH action
	in cultured murine Sertoli cells. Among these target transcripts,
	we identified the oligodendrocyte-specific protein (OSP), also known
	as claudin 11, which had recently been shown to play a key role in
	the formation of the hematotesticular barrier. Our data show that
	the testicular expression of OSP is dependent upon male gonad development
	and systemic and local signaling molecules. Indeed, OSP is expressed
	early in fetal development in Sertoli cells, immediately after the
	peak of SRY (sex-determining region, Y gene) expression, but just
	before that of the anti-Mullerian hormone. Postnatally, OSP expression
	starts to increase from day 3 to reach a plateau between days 6 and
	16 postnatally. In the prepubertal and adult testes, an apparent
	decline in OSP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels was found, probably because
	of the increasing number of germ cells (which do not express OSP).
	Among the signaling molecules that control testicular OSP expression,
	we have identified FSH and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha).
	Indeed, using a model of purified cultured mouse Sertoli cells, we
	demonstrate that FSH inhibits, in a dose (ED50 = 4 ng/ml)- and time
	(maximal effect after 24 h)-dependent manner, the levels of OSP mRNA.
	Such an inhibitory effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP, suggesting
	that FSH may use the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway to inhibit OSP
	mRNA levels. TNFalpha was also shown to inhibit OSP expression in
	cultured Sertoli cells. The maximal effect was observed after 48
	h of TNFalpha treatment with an ED50 of 4.5 ng/ml. Together, our
	results indicate that OSP expression 1) starts during fetal life
	at a critical period, probably under SRY control and during testicular
	formation; and 2) is regulated by hormones (FSH) and cytokines (TNFalpha)
	in the adult testis, suggesting a critical role for these molecules

	but estradiol had no effect. T also promoted claudin-11 localisation
	into extensive intercellular contacts. In contrast to claudin-11,
	Tand FSH did not change occludin mRNA expression, however, T promoted
	localisation of occludin at cell contacts in a similar manner to
	claudin-11. Addition of flutamide to T-stimulated cells caused a
	twofold decrease in both TER and claudin-11 mRNA expression, and
	resulted in the loss of both proteins from cell contacts. This effect
	was reversible following flutamide removal. It is concluded that
	androgens i) co-regulate claudin-11 mRNA expression and TER, implicating
	claudin-11 in TJ formation and ii) promote the localisation of claudin-11

	genes that will ensure the further differentiation and maintenance
	of Sertoli cells. Over the last few years several genes have been
	found that have important roles in gonadal development and sex determination.
	These include genes encoding transcription factors such as Lhx9,

	for both the initiation and maintenance of Sertoli cell differentiation.
	Data will be presented that are consistent with SRY acting directly
	on Sox9 to ensure its up-regulation. SF1 is also central to gonadal
	differentiation. Our results imply that it contributes to transcriptional
	activation of several relevant genes, not just those required for

	In the testis, the barrier is formed at the initiation of puberty
	by a tight junction complex between adjacent Sertoli cells, thereby
	defining an adluminal compartment where meiosis and spermiogenesis
	occur. Claudin 11 is an obligatory protein for tight junction formation
	and barrier integrity in the testis. It is expressed by Sertoli cells,
	and spermatogenesis does not proceed beyond meiosis in its absence,
	resulting in male sterility. Sertoli cell maturation--arrest of proliferation

	tight junction assembly; however, the pathophysiology underlying
	the loss of tight junctions in the mature testis remains largely

	that adult Cldn11(-/-) mouse Sertoli cells can proliferate while
	maintaining expression of mature markers. Sertoli cells detach from
	the basement membrane, acquire a fibroblast cell shape, are eliminated
	through the lumen together with apoptotic germ cells, and are found
	in epididymis. These changes are associated with tight junction regulation
	as well as actin-related and cell cycle gene expression. Thus, Cldn11(-/-)

	the spring and summer. Seasonal reproductive quiescence putatively
	reflects the energetic incompatibility of breeding and thermoregulatory
	activities. However, so-called "out-of-season" breeding occurs in
	virtually all rodent populations examined, suggesting that the incompatibility
	can be resolved. Both reproductive inhibition and development of
	energy-saving adaptations are mediated by environmental photoperiod,
	but some individuals do not inhibit reproduction in short days. In
	order to assess the costs and benefits of winter breeding, the present
	study examined the extent to which male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster)
	and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) that maintained summer reproductive
	function in winter-simulated daylengths also maintained summer thermoregulatory
	adaptations. Circadian locomotor activity patterns, basal metabolic
	rate, capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis, nest building, body
	mass, and daily food consumption were compared among short-day (LD
	8:16) regressed males, short-day (LD 8:16) nonregressed males, and
	long-day (LD 16:8) males. Short-day nonregressed deer mice resembled
	long-day conspecifics in terms of body mass and nest-building activities;
	however, the locomotor activity pattern of short-day nonregressed
	deer mice was similar to that of their short-day regressed conspecifics.
	Short-day nonregressed prairie voles had body masses similar to those
	of long-day conspecifics. Regardless of their reproductive response
	to photoperiod, short-day prairie voles reduced their daily food
	consumption and wheel-running activity, compared to long-day voles.
	These results suggest that winter breeding has energetic costs, most
	likely resulting from maintaining a "summer-like" body mass relative
	to that of reproductively regressed animals. These costs may be ameliorated
	to some extent by the reduction in locomotor activity and nest-building
	behavior emitted by short-day animals, regardless of reproductive
	response to short days. Thus, the occurrence of winter breeding may
	be the result of sufficient numbers of reproductively photoperiod-nonresponsive
	morphs in the population and sufficiently mild ambient conditions
	to permit survival of these larger animals.},

  abstract = {The mammalian Y chromosome acts as a dominant male determinant as
	a result of the action of a single gene, Sry, whose role in sex determination
	is to initiate testis rather than ovary development from early bipotential
	gonads. It does so by triggering the differentiation of Sertoli cells
	from supporting cell precursors, which would otherwise give follicle
	cells. The related autosomal gene Sox9 is also known from loss-of-function
	mutations in mice and humans to be essential for Sertoli cell differentiation;
	moreover, its abnormal expression in an XX gonad can lead to male
	development in the absence of Sry. These genetic data, together with
	the finding that Sox9 is upregulated in Sertoli cell precursors just
	after SRY expression begins, has led to the proposal that Sox9 could
	be directly regulated by SRY. However, the mechanism by which SRY
	action might affect Sox9 expression was not understood. Here we show
	that SRY binds to multiple elements within a Sox9 gonad-specific
	enhancer in mice, and that it does so along with steroidogenic factor
	1 (SF1, encoded by the gene Nr5a1 (Sf1)), an orphan nuclear receptor.
	Mutation, co-transfection and sex-reversal studies all point to a
	feedforward, self-reinforcing pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively
	upregulate Sox9 and then, together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the
	enhancer to help maintain its own expression after that of SRY has
	ceased. Our results open up the field, permitting further characterization
	of the molecular mechanisms regulating sex determination and how
	they have evolved, as well as how they fail in cases of sex reversal.},

  abstract = {A human autosomal XY sex reversal locus, SRA1, associated with the
	skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia (CMPD1), has
	been placed at distal 17q. The SOX9 gene, a positional candidate
	from the chromosomal location and expression pattern reported for
	mouse Sox9, was isolated and characterized. SOX9 encodes a putative
	transcription factor structurally related to the testis-determining
	factor SRY and is expressed in many adult tissues, and in fetal testis
	and skeletal tissue. Inactivating mutations on one SOX9 allele identified
	in nontranslocation CMPD1-SRA1 cases point to haploinsufficiency
	for SOX9 as the cause for both campomelic dysplasia and autosomal
	XY sex reversal. The 17q breakpoints in three CMPD1 translocation
	cases map 50 kb or more from SOX9.},

  abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in sexual differentiation
	and in the virilization of the male reproductive system. A clear
	understanding of AR expression at the early stages of sexual development
	will help elucidate the sensitivity of perinatal animals to endocrine
	modulation by external agents, such as some environmental chemicals.
	Immunohistochemistry was used in this study to localize the AR in
	the differentiating testis and epididymis of Sprague-Dawley rats
	starting from gestation day 15 until postnatal day 21. Positive AR
	staining was found on gestation day 15 in the mesenchymal as well
	as in the epithelial cells in the mesonephros. Weak staining was
	also observed in a small number of interstitial cells in the primordial
	testis at this age. The fetal interstitial and peritubular myoid
	cells showed positive AR immunoreactivity early in development, but
	the Sertoli cells did not overtly express the receptors until postnatal
	day 5. The intensity of staining and number of AR-positive cells
	in the testis and epididymis increased over time. The epithelium
	in the mesonephros-derived tissues, including rete testis and epididymis,
	appeared to exhibit a higher capacity to express AR than the rest
	of the testicular tissue. The results demonstrate that AR expression
	in the primordial male reproductive system is highly specific to
	time and cell type and modify previous understanding on the timing
	of AR expression in the testicular tissue. Since AR-positive cells
	at various developmental stages may be potential sites of interaction
	with chemicals that adversely affect sexual differentiation, improved
	understanding of AR ontogeny will help in investigating the effects
	of AR-reactive agents, such as environmental antiandrogens, with
	respect to specific windows of sensitivity.},

  abstract = {There is considerable variation, both within and between species,
	in reports of nuclear steroid receptor localizations in the male
	reproductive tract. In this study, androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen
	receptors ERalpha and ERbeta were visualized by immunohistochemistry
	in adult male mice reproductive tracts, including testes, efferent
	ductules; initial segment, caput, corpus, and cauda epididymides;
	and vas deferens. Antibody specificity was demonstrated by Western
	blot and antibody competition. In testis, AR was expressed in Leydig
	cells, Sertoli cells, and most peritubular cells, but not in germ
	cells; Sertoli cells showed more intense staining in stages VI-VII;
	ERalpha was present in Leydig and some peritubular cells; ERbeta
	was in Leydig, some peritubular, all Sertoli and germ cells except
	in spermatids and meiotic spermatocytes. In efferent ductules, AR
	was strongly expressed in ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells
	and in stromal cells; ERalpha was strongly expressed in ciliated
	and nonciliated epithelial cells; stromal cells were negative; and
	ERbeta was strongly expressed in ciliated and nonciliated epithelial
	cells and also in stromal cells. In epididymis, AR was strongly expressed
	in all epithelial cells (not in intraepithelial lymphocytes); ERalpha
	was strongly expressed in apical, narrow, and some basal cells of
	the initial segment, and in caput, principal cells of the caput,
	clear cells of the distal caput through cauda; stromal cells were
	negative in the initial segment, but more stromal cells were stained
	from caput to cauda; ERbeta was strongly expressed in most of epithelial
	cells of the epididymis, but stromal cells were inconsistently stained.
	In vas deferens, AR was weakly expressed or absent in principal cells
	but moderately stained in basal cells, smooth muscle cells of stroma
	were stained intensely, ERalpha was absent in epithelial cells but
	present in a subepithelial smooth muscle layer, and ERbeta was strongly
	expressed in all epithelial cells and most stromal cells. This study
	demonstrates that the reproductive tracts of male mice differ considerably
	from those of rats in expression of ARs and ERs and that caution
	is needed when extrapolating nuclear steroid receptor data across
	mammalian species.},
